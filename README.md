# AttackLabs

### Welcome to my Repository!

In this repository, you'll find my journey through various hands-on labs focused on cryptographic techniques and security vulnerabilities. Stemming from SeedLabs, these labs have provided me a foundation in understanding several core concepts in cybersecurity. Let me walk you through a brief summary of the key labs I've explored:

---

#### 1. üîê **Secret Key Encryption Lab:**

**Objective:** Delve into the intricacies of secret key cryptography.

- **Overview:** This lab illuminated the principles of symmetric encryption algorithms. Through hands-on tasks, I encrypted and decrypted data using secret keys and assessed vulnerabilities that arise from poor key management.

#### 2. üåê **SQL Injection Lab:**

**Objective:** Unravel the threats posed by SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

- **Overview:** Here, I set up intentionally vulnerable web applications to understand and exploit SQL injection attacks. From bypassing logins to extracting confidential database information, this lab was an eye-opener on the importance of secure coding practices.

#### 3. üîç **MD5 Hash Collision Lab:**

**Objective:** Explore the fascinating world of cryptographic hash functions, with a spotlight on the MD5 algorithm.

- **Overview:** Cryptographic hash functions like MD5 are ubiquitous in the cybersecurity realm. In this lab, I ventured into generating MD5 hash values and experimentally found hash collisions, reiterating the need for the adoption of more robust hash functions in real-world applications.


I invite you to navigate through the codes, findings, and reflections I've documented for each lab. It's been an enlightening experience, and I hope my repository offers valuable insights to fellow security enthusiasts or anyone curious about the intricacies of cybersecurity.
